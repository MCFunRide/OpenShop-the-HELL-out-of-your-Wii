# OpenShop the HELL out of your Wii

What the wiki portion of this repository will aim to do is assist you in setting up an apache2 server and a squid3 server for using the Open Shop Channel (https://github.com/OpenShopChannel) on your Wii or Virtual Wii console.

We will go through the fundamentals of installing an apache2 server and then editing the /etc/hosts file to include a redirection for the Wii Shop Channel's server URL which will lead us onto creating and implementing an SSL certificate into the apache2 server, which will allow the Wii to connect to our site properly. We'll then finish off by setting up squid3 as the proxy server for our Wii (U) systems.
